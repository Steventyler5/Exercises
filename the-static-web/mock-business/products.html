      <h3>The Woods were made for all of us, and the only obstacle is you.</h3>
      <p>Here at Smoky Mountain Backpacking we believe the only barrier between and the great outdoors should be your personal willingness. We believe age, level of fitness, and wealth are immaterial and shouldn't prevent <strong>anyone</strong> from sleeping under the stars or exploring the wilderness.</p>

      <p>Smoky Mountain Backpacking has provided legendary service to backpackers, hikers, and campers in the Greater Appalachian Mountain Area since as long as anybody can remember. Our origins are damn near mythical. What have we learned in all our years out in the wild? Everything. We're honestly that good.</p>

      <h2>Who The Hell Are You</h2>
      <h3>I'm glad you asked, let's take a moment to meet SMB's leaders.</h3>

      <h4>C.E.O.</h4>
      <img src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/23/de/76/sk-tours-of-maine-llc.jpg" alt="Paul Bunyan, esq." width="300" height="225">
      <h5>Paul Bunyan, esq.</h5>
      <p>Meet Paul. Mr. Bunyan founded SMB with his partner Babe, starting from the ground up. Literally. Paul Chopped and milled every timber of our walls, mined every stone in our foundation, and (with the help of Mr. Ross) painted every landscape you'll find in our store.</p>

      <h4>C.T.O.</h4>

      <h5>Angus MacGyver</h5>
      <p>Could anyone ask for a more capable Chief Technical Officer? No, we didn't think so either. Snap a ridgeline? Firestarter on the fritz? Jeep break down on the trail? Angus will have you up and running in a jiffy, using whatever he happens to have in his pockets and stuck the bottom of his boots at time. He'll probably get the girl too!</p>

      <h5>Robin Hood</h5>
      <p>Do we know from whence all of Mr. Hoods finances originate? No. Do we care? Not if we can help it. Should you? Hell no! Robin works hard to ensure that we can bring you the lowest prices in town and still keep our doors open.</p>
