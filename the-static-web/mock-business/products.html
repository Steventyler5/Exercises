      <h2>Biolite CampStove</h2>
    </header>
    <section>

      <p>Imagine this-- freshly foraged chicken of the woods filets, pan cooked over an open fire courtesy of the BioLite CampStove, served with a side of wilted dandelion greens, and aromatic rosemary sprinkled atop warm, buttery rice. If your mouth is watering with anticipation and dreams of recreating such an idyllic, delicious scenario, you're in luck because the CampStove can make your gourmet camp food dreams a reality. Thanks to such an innovative stove, long gone are the days when your vittles were restricted to watery mac'n'cheese, peanut butter sandwiches, and questionable dehydrated food. The CampStove doesn't just provide savory meals--it's a stove, electrical power, and heat source all rolled into one. This convenient, self-sustaining stove is about the size of a 32 oz, BPA free water bottle, emanates smokeless flames, and its' advantageous powerpack easily nests within the heat mesh stove (just make sure the stove has cooled down before nesting). In place of cumbersome, excessive, and rather expensive fuel canisters, this easy-to-use stove only desires to be fueled with scrounged up twigs, pinecones, or any other flammable biomass that you discover whilst travelling. So you can forget about those eyebrow-raising fuel receipts and spend your money more wisely elsewhere, like on additional delicious frothy beverages or s'mores supplies. One of the most appealing aspects of the CampStove is its intuitive recycling of energy. While your chicken of the woods simmers in a sea of butter, your phone charges in 20 minutes time, providing an additional 60 minutes of talk time to the pre-existing battery life.</p>

    <section>
      <img src="images/decathlon.jpg" alt="Decathlon 2 Second Tent" width="300" height="225">
      <p>After spending all morning and afternoon bonding with your friends and/or family whilst hiking up and down the sides of mountains, don't you fucking hate having to pitch a tent when it comes time to set up camp? If so, this little beauty was practically made for you, my friend. The Decathlon 2 Second Pop Up Tent is literally what it claims to be: a tent that goes from "what's that awkward little sunshade lookin thing strapped to your pack?" to "HOLY SHIT IT'S TENT FOR TWO!!". One vigorous flick of the wrist and about 2 seconds of flight time (your mileage may vary, but Jesus Christ, a 100% delay is still just 4 entire seconds) you've got yourself one perfectly adequate tent!</p>
